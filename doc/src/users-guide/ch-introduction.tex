\section{What is INET Framework}

INET Framework contains IPv4, IPv6, TCP, SCTP, UDP protocol implementations,
and several application models. The framework also includes an MPLS model
with RSVP-TE and LDP signalling. Link-layer models are PPP, Ethernet and 802.11.
Static routing can be set up using network autoconfigurators, or one can use
routing protocol implementations. The INET Framework supports wireless and
mobile simulations as well.

\section{Scope of this Manual}
